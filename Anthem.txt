A Jester who does not belong to this era;

Mystical ruler above the gray fog;

King of Yellow and Black, master of luck

The symbol is a Pupil-less Eye and the Contorted Lines; 

represented secrecy and change.

It's a trojan horse of fate,

the slug of time,

the loopholes in rules, 

the manifestation of all errors.

Be careful of the ‘Spectator’.

Praise the Sun!

Roselle: This... The first thought that came to me was the Shepherd pathway which could engage in Devouring and Grazing, so as to control the souls and characteristics of other Beyonders.
