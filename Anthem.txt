A Jester who does not belong to this era;

Mystical ruler above the gray fog;

King of Yellow and Black, master of luck

The symbol is a Pupil-less Eye and the Contorted Lines; 

represented secrecy and change.

It's a trojan horse of fate,

the slug of time,

the loopholes in rules, 

the manifestation of all errors.

Be careful of the ‘Spectator’.

Praise the Sun!
